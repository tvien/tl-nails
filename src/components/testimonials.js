		comment: `BEAUTIFUL!! and I'm saying it again for the people in the back, this salon is BEAUTIFUL!! It truly is a hidden gem.

		I have been going to their Davis Island location for the past 16 years and would never go anywhere else. When I heard they opened another location I of course wanted to check it out.
		
		I'm a sucker for beautiful modern d√©cor and this place NAILS it for me. The staff is extremely friendly, the massage chairs are awesome and have adjustments specific for us short people, and the vibe is on point.
		
		I had dip manicure done and a citrus scrub pedicure and holy heck!! if you're looking to spoil yourself and not break the bank, please please please get the Citrus Scrub pedicure, you will not regret it. It took everything in me not to fall asleep because it was so relaxing and the massage and hot towels felt great.
		
		I live closer to their Davis Island location, but I think I'll still drive the extra distance to continue getting my nails done at the new salon!`,

		Patty typically does my waxing, and we alway enjoy a good laugh, as an added bonus. The staff is very friendly and it always feels like home.`,

		comment: `I have been visiting the T and L nails location on Davis Island for the last 2-3 months. I am new to the area as of this summer and was apprehensive about finding a a new nail salon. I am happy that I found T and L. The staff is welcoming and friendly and make an effort to remember their clients. Nisha always leaves my nails looking amazing!  I  also will sing their praises for going above and beyond for my daughter, friend, and I during our last appointment. We scheduled for Sunday afternoon, and had to cancel due to another obligation I double booked myself for. We were actually able to push the the appointment until later in the day and they went out of the way to make sure we were taken care of and could still be seen that day. That kind of service makes a lasting impression and is the reason I will continue to frequent this business.`,
